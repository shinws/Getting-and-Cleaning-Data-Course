Instructions

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and set a clean data.

Review criterial ÔÅ∑

1.The submitted data set is tidy.
2.The Github repo contains the required scripts.
3.GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries, along with units, and any other relevant information.
4.The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.
5.The work submitted for this project is the student who submitted it.

Getting and Cleaning Data Course

One of the most exciting areas of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The Samsung Galaxy S smartphone is the first Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here is the data for the project:

Https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Good luck!
